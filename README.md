This is a project built solely for educational purposes (for the time being) and is not guaranteed or even implied to function in any way. 

My intention with this project is to become more familiar with the way that languages and compilers are made and how they function, as well as to familiarize myself with asm x86_64 code generation. Once I have a turing complete language, I will attempt to build it up to the capacity that a compiler can be written in my language. Once that is complete, I will attempt to make programs written and compiled using solely my own language, and then after that will attempt to build a minimally functional bootloader and kernel in my language. This project will very probably take more than 5 years to 'complete', if such a word can even be used in this context. 

Feel free to fork or clone and do with it whatever you like.
